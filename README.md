# Geometry Wars
Game Architecture is based on an assignment created for Memorial University - Computer Science 4300 - Fall 2022 - Intro to Game Programming 

The starter files are not publicly available but are mostly covered on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/live/OmzU_-zbE7o?si=pXC0IXya6lctk343) .

To run the game, you will need the SFML graphics library.
